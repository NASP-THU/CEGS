*** Interface configuration *** :
For a Node A in topology T1:
1. Parse interface information
1) Extract Loopback Interface Information:
Retrieve the name and IP address(es) of Node A’s loopback interface from the provided node information in target topology T1.
2) Extract Physical Interface Information:
For each edge connected to Node A in topology T1:
If Node1 in the edge is Node A:
• Use node1's interface name and IP
If Node2 in the edge is Node A:
• Use node2's interface name and IPnd IP
2. Generate interface configuration based on the Node A's interface information.
Note: for each interface, you must set neighbor description in format: description "To {neighbor_node_name}", and set link cost value based on the intent in format: ip ospf cost {cost}.


*** OSPF basic configuration *** :
1. For a Node A in topology T1, first extract its ospf process id and networks running on it form the node information provided in the target topology;
2. Generate the OSPF configuration based on the ospf process id and network information.
