1. Each device runs OSPF protocol. Establish OSPF connections between each device and apply the necessary routing configurations, ensuring traffic from FortLa to Miami is routed through any valid path in [(FortLa, Hollyw, Miami), (FortLa, NodeID85, Orland, Tampa, Miami)].
2. Configure OSPF protocol on all nodes and configure appropriate routing policies to ensure that traffic from NodeID112 to Floren is forwarded along any available path in [(NodeID112, Sumter, NodeID103, Myrtle, Floren), (NodeID112, NodeID99, Charlo, Raleig, Fayatt, Floren)].
3. Set up BGP process on each router. Configure appropriate routing policies to guarantee that the traffic from Dayton to NodeID85 strictly adheres to the specified path (Dayton, Jackso, LakeCi, Gaines, Ocala, Orland, NodeID85).
4. Each device runs BGP protocol. Establish BGP connections between each device and implement the necessary routing policies to enforce that traffic originating from NodeID84 and destined for Newnah must traverse the designated route (NodeID84, Annist, AlexanID40, Auburn, Opelik, LagranID43, Lagran, Newnah).
