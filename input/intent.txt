1. Each device runs BGP protocol. Establish BGP connections between each device and configure appropriate routing policies to ensure that traffic from Dravog to Velenj prefers the path (Dravog, Sloven, Velenj) over path (Dravog, Maribo, Lasko, Celje, Velenj).
2. Set up BGP process on each router. Configure appropriate routing policies on nodes to ensure that traffic from Ljublj to Kranj prioritizes route (Ljublj, Koper, Kranj) over (Ljublj, NovaGo, Tolmin, Bled, Kranj).
3. Set up OSPF process on all nodes. Configure appropriate routing policies on nodes to ensure that traffic from Koper to Divaca is load-balance between path (Koper, Izola, Portor, Divaca) and path (Koper, Ljublj, NovaGo, Ajdovs, Divaca).
